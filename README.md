# Hide my email (for Gmail™)
## Overview
[Install the chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-inbox-hider/koobmglbcddgeoopgphanmhjppfaehaa?hl=en) so you can use Gmail™ in a calmer, more intentional way. 
 
The extension adds a button to Gmail™ that lets you hide your emails whenever you want. While your emails are hidden, you can still use the top search bar to find specific emails or conversations, but emails and red alert badges won't appear. Since this is a browser extension, it only works if you use Gmail's™ web app.
