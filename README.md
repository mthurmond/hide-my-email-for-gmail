# Hide My Email for Gmail™
## Update
As of December 12th, 2022, this extension has been temporarily removed from the Chrome Web Store. Another developer filed a copywrite notice claiming infringement, and Google automatically removed the extension due to this filing, as is their policy. I have filed a counter notification in order to get the extension back up as quickly as possible. 

In the meantime, you can still use this extension by doing the following:
1. Download the "extension" folder in this repo
2. Go to "chrome://extensions/"
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and upload the "extensions" folder. 

Once the extension is re-listed in the Chrome Web Store, I will post an update here. I am hoping it will be by Wednesday December 28th 2022. Thanks to all the loyal users here! 

## Overview
Install the chrome extension above so you can use Gmail™ in a calmer, more intentional way. 
 
The extension adds a button to Gmail™ that lets you hide your emails whenever you want. While your emails are hidden, you can still use the top search bar to find specific emails or conversations, but emails and red alert badges won't appear. Since this is a browser extension, it only works if you use Gmail's™ web app.
